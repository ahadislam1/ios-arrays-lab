# Part 1

## Question 1

Create an array of strings called `colors` that contain "orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", and "lavender".

Then, using array subscripting and string interpolation, print out the String `"orange, yellow, and lavender are some of my favorite colors"`.

answer:
```swift
let colors = ["orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", "lavender"]
print ("\(colors[0]), \(colors[2]), and \(colors[4]) are some of my favorite colors.")
```

## Question 2

Remove "Illinois" and "Kansas" from the array below.

`var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]`

answer:
```swift
westernStates.remove(at: 4)
westernStates.remove(at: 4)
print(westernStates)

//or
westernStates.removeLast()
westernStates.removeLast()
print(westernStates)

//or
var i = 0
while i < 2 {
    westernStates.popLast()
    i += 1
}
print(westernStates)
```
## Question 3

Iterate through the array below. For each state, print out the name of the state, a colon, and whether it is or is not **in the continental United States.**

`let moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]`

answer:
```swift
let moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]
var continentalUS = true
for state in moreStates {
    state == "Hawaii" || state == "Alaska" ? print("\(state): is not in the continental US") : print("\(state): is in the continental US")
}
```

## Question 4

Print out how many non-whitespace characters are in `myString`:

`let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"`

answer:
```swift
let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"
var nonSpaceChars = 0
for elem in myString {
    if elem != " " {
        nonSpaceChars += 1
    }
}
print("The sentence myString has \(nonSpaceChars) non-whitespace characters.")
```

Iterate through the array below. For each sentence, print out how many non-whitespace characters are in it.

`let myFavoriteQuotes = ["To be or not to be, that is the question.", "The only source of knowledge is experience.", "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!", "Four score and twenty years ago..."]`

answer:
```swift
var nonSpaceChars = 0
let myFavoriteQuotes = ["To be or not to be, that is the question.", "The only source of knowledge is experience.", "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!", "Four score and twenty years ago..."]
for quote in myFavoriteQuotes {
    for elem in quote {
        if elem != " " {
            nonSpaceChars += 1
        }
    }
    print("The sentence: '\(quote)' has \(nonSpaceChars) non-whitespace characters.")
    nonSpaceChars = 0
}
```


## Question 5

Iterate through `garden` and place any ðŸŒ· that you find into the `basket`. Replace any ðŸŒ· that you pick up with `"dirt"`. Then print how many ðŸŒ· are in your `basket`.

```swift
var garden = ["dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt"]
var basket = [String]()
```
answer:
```swift
var garden = ["dirt", "ðŸŒ·", "dirt", "ðŸŒ·", "dirt", "dirt", "ðŸŒ·", "dirt", "ðŸŒ·", "dirt"]
var basket = [String]()
for index in 0..<garden.count where garden[index] == "ðŸŒ·" {
    garden[index] = "dirt"
    basket.append("ðŸŒ·")
}
print("There are \(basket.count) ðŸŒ· in my basket.")
```
## Question 6

The below array represents an unfinished batting lineup for a baseball team. **You, the coach,** need to make some last minute changes:

- Add "Suzuki" to the end of your lineup.
- Change "Jeter" to "Tejada".
- Change "Thomas" for "Guerrero"
- Put "Reyes" to bat 8th instead.

`var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]`

answer:
```swift
var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols", "Griffey", "Thomas", "Jones", "Rodriguez"]
battingLineup.append("Suzuki")
battingLineup[1] = "Tejada"
battingLineup[5] = "Guerrero"
battingLineup.swapAt(0, 7)
print(battingLineup)
```
## Question 7

Given an array of Ints, find out if it contains a target number.  

(The built-in `contains(_:)` function will do this, but you aren't allowed to use it for this exercise.)


```swift
var numbers: [Int]

let target: Int = 32
```

Ex.1

```swift
numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]

target = 32

//true
```

Ex. 2

```swift
numbers = [32459,2,4,5,1,4,2,1]

target = 3

//false
```
answer:
```swift
var numbers = [Int]()
var isThereTarget = false
let target: Int = 32
//i made a for loop to insert a consecutive array, i didn't want to type one out.
for num in 1...52 {
    numbers.append(num)
}
print(numbers)
for number in 0..<numbers.count where numbers[number] == target {
    print("The array contains the target number \(target) at indice \(number)")
    isThereTarget = true
}
isThereTarget ? print(true) : print(false)
```

## Question 8

Find the largest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built-in `max()` method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```
answer:
```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}
var maxNumberArray : Int = 0
for number in arrayOfNumbers where number >= maxNumberArray {
    maxNumberArray = number
}
print("The max number in the array is \(maxNumberArray)")
```


## Question 9

Find the smallest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built in min() method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```
answer:
```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}
var minNumberArray : Int = 200
for number in arrayOfNumbers where number <= minNumberArray {
    minNumberArray = number
}
print("The min number in the array is \(maxNumberArray)")
```


## Question 10

Iterate through `secondListOfNumbers`, and print out all the odd numbers.

`var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404]`


## Question 11

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`
answer (*note: i could've used a for loop, but i thought might as well try a loop i haven't done in awhile)
```swift
var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 49, 74, 3, 22, 23]
var thirdListSum : Int = 0
var i = 0
while i < thirdListOfNumbers.count {
    thirdListSum += thirdListOfNumbers[i]
    i += 1
}
print (thirdListSum)
```


## Question 12

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum of all the even numbers.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`

answer:
```swift
var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 49, 74, 3, 22, 23]
var thirdListSum : Int = 0
var i = 0
while i < thirdListOfNumbers.count {
    if thirdListOfNumbers[i] % 2 == 0 {
        thirdListSum += thirdListOfNumbers[i]
    }
    i += 1
}
print (thirdListSum)
```

## Question 13

Append every Int that appears in both `listOne` and `listTwo` to the `sharedElements` array. Then print **how many Ints** are shared.

```swift
var listOne = [28, 64, 7, 96, 13, 32, 94, 11, 80, 68]
var listTwo = [18, 94, 48, 6, 42, 68, 79, 76, 13, 7]
var sharedElements = [Int]()
```
convert to set answer:
```swift
var listOne = [28, 64, 7, 96, 13, 32, 94, 11, 80, 68]
var listTwo = [18, 94, 48, 6, 42, 68, 79, 76, 13, 7]
var listOneSet = Set(listOne)
var listTwoSet = Set(listTwo)
var sharedElementsSet = listOneSet.intersection(listTwoSet)
var sharedElements = Array(sharedElementsSet)
print (sharedElements)
```
"regular" answer:
```swift
var listOne = [28, 64, 7, 96, 13, 32, 94, 11, 80, 68]
var listTwo = [18, 94, 48, 6, 42, 68, 79, 76, 13, 7]
var sharedElements = [Int]()
for num in listOne {
    for num2 in listTwo {
        if num == num2 {
            sharedElements.append(num)
        }
    }
}
print (sharedElements)
```

# Part 2

## Question 1

Write code such that `noDupeList` has all the same Ints as `dupeFriendlyList`, but has no more than one of each Int.

```swift
var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var noDupeList: [Int] = []
```
answer:
```swift
var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var noDupleList: [Int] = []
for index in 0..<dupeFriendlyList.count {
    if noDupleList.contains(dupeFriendlyList[index]) == false {
        noDupleList.append(dupeFriendlyList[index])
    }
}
print(noDupleList)
```

var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var set = Set(dupeFriendlyList)
print(set)
```
## Question 2

answer:
```swift
var multiplesOf3Or5 = [Int]()
for num in 1...1000 {
    if num % 3 == 0 || num % 5 == 0 {
        multiplesOf3Or5.append(num)
